CHALLANGES YOU FACE AT WORK
Once, when our project release was delayed and i co-ordinated with my team members to get the schedule back on track. we trouleshot the issues and solved the problems. Upon further investigation, i found out that lack of communication and restriction of knowledge among a few team members was main issue. so we have decided for the team that would come together and discuss the advancements of the project. That challenge thaught me that along with the technology, proper communication drives a project to completion.



SALARY EXPECTATION
i dont doubt AKQA will offer me a competatative salary within the company standards, it seems i will have great development opportunity and experience of working at your company, I am sure we can come to an agreement on the salary.
